# Rethinking the Computer Music Language: SuperCollider
As someone working on audio systems design, this article/assignment pairing was a great case study. It highlighted the particular needs of audio-specific programming, albeit with a focus on composition. In particular, I was interested in the modularity of SuperCollider 3 (separation of server from client) and the meta-programming architecture. This is extremely pertinent to the work I'm doing regarding meta-programming for embedded devices, in which users will be able to script firmware generation using a drag-n-drop interface.
