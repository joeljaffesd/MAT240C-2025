# ChucK: A Strongly Timed Computer Music Language

## Prelude
ChucK was actually the first audio programming language I ever used. I had discovered it somehow and was playing with it on my dad's computer via the WebChuck browser-based IDE. You can probably guess what happened: I fought errors for a while trying to get it to make sound, and when I finally got it to sing, the amplitude was 1.0 and it blasted my ears with a deafening sine tone, something I don't believe they had experienced up to that point. I promptly entered an "audio programming winter" in which I didn't touch the subject for many years.

## Reading
In class, ChucK was introduced as equal part joke and toy, corroborated by some of its features such as the keywords `fun` and `spork~`.

The paper provided an introduction to the language that really dispelled that conception of it for me. In particular, its concept of `now` and a sort of "playhead" for organizing all events, regardless of time scale, with the same logic seems like a really useful innovation.

The examples in Figure 1 and 2, despite their conciseness, immediately spurred imaginations of how I might implement things like filters and effects in the language.

I read the paper prior to doing the code portion of the assignment so, I'm about to see if my newfound, more positive view of the language will survive the task of actually using it.
